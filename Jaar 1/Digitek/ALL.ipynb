    "# Chapter 1: Number systems and codes\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a positive number N can be written as \n",
    "$$ N = (a_{n-1} a_{n-2} \\dots a_{0} \\cdot a_{-1} a_{-2} \\dots a_{-m}  )_r $$\n",
    "where:  \n",
    "- $\\cdot$ = radix point seperating integer and fractional digits\n",
    "- r = base of number system\n",
    "- n = number digits to the left of radix point\n",
    "- m = numer digits to the right of radix point\n",
    "\n",
    "to get the value of it, you do $$\\sum_{i=n}^m {a_i} \\cdot r^{i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Common bases are octal, hexadecimal, binary and decimal (8, 16, 2 and 10 respectively)\n",
    "Base 2: 01  \n",
    "Base 8: 01234567  \n",
    "Base 16: 0123456789ABCDEF  \n",
    "To convert from base 2 to 16, group them in groups of 4 digits from the right and convert those individually to their hex representative. Same for bin to octal but with groups of 3. Do the reverse when doing the reverse(create groups of 3 or 4 from the higher base).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- 1101101011010 from binary to hex = (0001)(1011)(0101)(1010) = 1B5A\n",
    "- 0101101011010 from binary to octal = (000)(101)(101)(011)(010) = 05532\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Radix complement\n",
    "For binary, you can use 2 quick methods to calculate the bits of a negative number.\n",
    "- one's complement: just use bitwise not on the number. eg. 4 = 00100; -4 = 11011   \n",
    "- two's complement: use bitwise not + 1. eg. 4 = 00100; -4 = 11100 (11011 + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, negative numbers are often displayed with radix complement. the positive numbers stay the same, and the negative numbers are the complement of the positive one. \n",
    "The formula for any radix' complement is \n",
    "$$[N]_r = r^n - (N)_r$$  \n",
    "where n = the number of digits in $(N)_r$  \n",
    "$[N]_r$ = the radix complement  \n",
    "and $(N)_r$ is the number in whatever base representation\n",
    "\n",
    "example:\n",
    "Determine two's complement of (N)2 = (01100101)2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[N]_2 = [01100101]_2 = 2^8 - (01100101)_2 = (100000000)_2 - (01100101)_2 = (10011011)_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Find 10's complement of 40960  \n",
    "$[N]_{10} = 10^5 - (40960)_{10} = (59040)_{10}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides using radix' complement to represent negative numbers, it is also used to lower the number of complex circuitry needed to calculate stuff. For example, A - B can be computed as A + (-B)\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate arithmic in two's complement system, consider these cases\n",
    "with B >=0 and C>= 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A = B + C. Since Both B and C are nonnegative, A is nonnegative and simply $(A)_2 = (B)_2 + (C)_2$, no need for complement  \n",
    "  \n",
    "2. A = B - C, treated as A = B + (-C).  $A = (B)_2 + [C]_2; A = (B)_2  + 2^n - (C)_2;A = 2^n + (B- C)_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A = -B - C  \n",
    " A = -(B+C) = [B+C] = 2^n + [B+C]  \n",

    "The __diminished radix complement__ $[N]_{r-1}$ can be defined as $[N]_{r-1} = r^n - (N)_r - 1$ (Radix complement - 1)  \n",
    "__Fixed point numbers__ are numbers with a _fixed_ ammount of digits set before and after the radix. (Not how floats are stored normally, btw)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Offset binary aka excess-K,excess-N, excess code or biased representation__, is a digital coding scheme where all-zero corresponds to the minimal negative value and all-one to the maximal positive value. There is no standard for offset binary, but most often the offset K for an n-bit binary word is K = 2nâˆ’1. This has the consequence that the \"zero\" value is represented by a 1 in the most significant bit and zero in all other bits, and in general the effect is conveniently the same as using two's complement except that the most significant bit is inverted\n",

    "\n",
    "__Floating point numbers(floats)__ are represented as $N = M \\cdot r^E$ where M the _mantissa(significand)_, is a fixed-point\n",
    "number containing the significant digits of N, and E, the _exponent or characteristic_, is a fixed point integer. \n",
    "The base of the mantissa is always even.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is most often stored in this format: [sign][Exponent E][mantissa]\n",
    "The exponent E is often coded in _excess-K two's complement._  \n",
    "A float is __normalized__, and this means that E is adjusted such that the most significant bit is 1\n",

    "BCD uses 4 bit binary to represent 0-9 and are often used to output to numerical displays.\n",
